	<h3>Welcome to the C++ tutorials! The lessons in these tutorials are primarily designed to help beginning level programmers get
	a hands on grasp of the fundamentals of C++. Each turtorial is broken down into sections which contain examples, in depth 
	explainations of code, and practice files for users to implement and test their own code! there is no suggested amount of 
	time that you should spend with each section; progress through the material at a pace that is comfortable for you.
	Before we get started, you will find that each chapter of this curriculum will be structured in a similar fashion.</p>
	<h1>Lesson</h1>
	<p>
	In order to code, it is important to understand the basic concept on how C++ works. Each section will contain a README.md file that
	 provides a detailed description on how the specific topic covered works, and a tutorial on how to implement that specific code.
	 </p>
	<h1>Executable Terminal Program</h1>
	<p>Similar to any spoken language, C++ and all programming languages have a specific syntax or way on how things are written. To give 
	you practice on C++ syntax, each lesson will include an interactive file that allows you to practice typing in the C++ language.
	</p>
	<h1>Practice Assignments</h1>
	<p>The key to becoming a great programmer is practice. In these tutorials, we have provided templates and test files for you to 
	practice implementing your own code. Each section will have their own assignment in which you can practice writing your own code, 
	and test files for each assignment so you'll know whether or not you have implemented your code correctly.
	Remember, learning how to program takes a bit of patience, so be sure that you take your time when going through these lessons.
	Have fun!

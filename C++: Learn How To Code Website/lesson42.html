	<p>
		In reference to functions, so far we've only worked with main() with the exception of some helper functions in a lab assignment.  In C++ a function is defined as a group of statements given a name, 
		it's important that the main body of work goes inside a "main" function because C++ is conditioned to look for that name, but we can have other functions that will be referenced inside main.  
	</p>
</div>

<div id="content"> 
	<h1>Function Basics</h1>
	<p>
		The syntax for a function is:
	</p>
	<pre>
		type name(parameter, parameter, parameter,...){
			statement
			statement
			...
		}
	</pre>
	<p>
		An example of how you might use functions could be like this (This will also help explain what's going on in the previous lab assignment if you got confused)
	</p>
	<pre>
		int functolicious(int x, int y, int z){
		}
	</pre>
	<pre>
		string repeatthrice(string x){
		}
	</pre>
	<pre>
		int main(){
			if (functolicious(5, 10, 3) == 0)\
			{
				cout << "Functolicious Passed!" << endl;
			}
			else
			{
				cout << "Functolicious failed." << endl;
			}
			if (repeatthrice("hello") == "hellohellohello")
			{
				cout << "repeatthrice passed!" << endl;
			}
			else
			{
				cout << "repeatthrice failed." << endl;
			}	
	</pre>
	<p>
		So first the program would be conditioned to go to the main function, it reads the line:
	</p>
	<pre>
		if (functolicious(5, 10, 3) == 0)
	</pre>
	<p>
		When you use the name of a function and send it it's parameters (in this case 5, 10, and 3) that's known as a "function call"
	</p>
	<p>
		We have functolicious set up like so:
	</p>
	<pre>
		int functolicious(int x, int y, int z){
		}
	</pre>
	<p>
		The return type of the function is int, the name is functolicious, and it's parameters are three int's we called x y and z, so when we did our function call functolicious(5, 10, 3) we're pretty much
		saying:
	</p>
	<pre>
		x = 5;
		y = 10;
		z = 3;
	</pre>
	<p>
		And then going from there! The last statement of the function has to be:
	</p>
	<pre>
		return value;
	</pre>
	<p>
		In this case, because we need something to send back to main since it was called there, that value that is returned is then compared to 0 and the function main continues!
		Generally if theres a set of statements you want some values to under go over and over again, you might find it helpful to make a helper function to do it for you! 
	</p>
	<h1>
		Void Functions
	</h1>
	<p>
		Sometimes we might want a function to do something that doesn't require returning a value back to main. Say we're in need of morale support, so we want to make a void function to cheer us on!
		We might write it like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		#include <iostream>
			using namespace std;
			
			void moralesupport(){
				cout << "You can do it!" << endl;
			}
			int main(){
				moralesupport();
			}
	</pre>
	<h2>
		Some things you might have noticed..
	</h2>
	<p>
		First off, you might have noticed that whenver we are referencing a function there are always some form of parentheses involved, that's so the compiler can differentiate between variables and a function.
		So x can be different than x() for example.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing is that you might be wondering why main() has no return statement, it does! Kind of, the compiler automatically assumes in main that we will return 0 which essentially evaluates to
		nothing. 
	</p>
	<h1>
		Recursive Functions
	</h1>
	<p>
		This is a complicated concept, but it's very useful.  It's based off the principle that functions are able to call themselves!
		The most basic example of a recursive function is one that solves factorials.  Here's an example:
	</p>
	<pre>
		#include <iostream>
			using namespace std;
			int factorial(int x){
				if( x > 1){
					return(x * factorial(x-1));
					}
					else
					{
						return 1;
					}
					}
			int main(){
				int x = 5;
				cout << factorial(x) << endl;
				}
	</pre>
	<p>
		We can see in main that we're just sending 5 to the function factorial to be printed out, but in the factorial function we can see that it calls itself when x is greater than 1!
	</p>
	<p>
		An important thing to set up is a base case, in this function our base case is the:
	</p>
	<pre>
		else
		{
			return 1;
		}
	</pre>
	<p>
		A base case is rock bottom, once we hit rock bottom we can start returning upwards to get our final result.  I'll elaborate more on that in a bit.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our recursive function traverses like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		We have the line return(x * factorial(x-1)), in this case, x is 5 so it reads: 
		5 * factorial(4), and factorial 4 will evaluate to be 4 * factorial(3), extrapolating we get:
		5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1), and so when we get to 1 we hit our base case, where we're told to just return 1 instead of going any deeper down the rabbit hole recursively!
		So we get our final answer, which is 120!

<div id = "intro">
	<p>
		Now we're going to start really digging into the interesting stuff with your coding assignments.  In this chapter we're going to learn about operators in C++ and how we use them (namely to implement arithmetic)
	</p>
</div>

<div id="content"> 
	<h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1>
	<p>
		Just briefly I wanted to bring up the "=" operator, in C++ it's called the 'Assignment Operator', we used it before when we wanted to assign values to our variables, like x = 5.  Anyways...
		Your arithmetic operators are: 
	<pre>
		+	addition		
		-	subtraction
		*	multiplication
		/	division
		%	modulo, modulo is similar to division except it gives you the remainder (e.g. 11 % 3 will return 2, since 11/3 gives a remainder of 2
	</pre>
	<h1>
		Compound Assignment Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		These operators are shortcuts of sort, they're used when you have an existing variable that you'd like to perform an operation on.  The ones for arithmetic are:  
	</p>
	<pre>
		+=	addition
		-=	subtraction
		*=	multiplication
		/=	division
		%=	modulo
	</pre>
	<p>
		Say you have a variable x, x holds the value 5 and we want to add 5 more to it so x holds 10, you could write this like:
	</p>
	<pre>
		x = x + 5
		x += 5
	</pre>
	<p>
		Both of these would be valid and would end with x being set equal to 10, the same concept applies to the rest of the compound assignment operators
	</p>
	<h1>
		Increment and Decrement Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		These operators are typically used in loops (control structures that you'll be learning about soon!), they're useful when we want to add or subtract 1 from an already exisiting variable. They are:
	</p>
	<pre>
		++	Increment
		--	Decrement
	</pre>
	<p>
		So for example:
	</p>
	<pre>
		x++
		x += 1
		x = x + 1
	</pre>
	<p>
		<b>
			Would all do the same thing!
		</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		One important thing to note is using the increment/decrement operator as a suffix versus using it as a prefix  
		If the operator is used as a prefix, the value is incremented/decremented and then evaluated, if the operator is used as a suffix, the value is evaluated and then incremented/decremented
		For example:
	</p>
	<pre>
		x = 0
		y = ++x
		x would hold 0, y would hold 1
	</pre>
	<pre>
		x = 0
		y = x++
		x would hold 0, y would also hold 0
	</pre>
	<h1>
		Comparison Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		These are operators we use to determine if values are greater than, less than, or equal to other values.  The result of these operators is a "true or false" (or boolean) output.
		These operators are:
	</p>
	<pre>
		==	Equal to
		!=	Not equal to
		<	Less than
		>	Greater than
		<=	Less than or equal to
		>=	Greater than or equal to
	</pre>
	<p>
		This is important later when we learn to use conditional statements, but some examples are:  
	</p>
	<pre>
		1 == 1	returns true
		2 <=1	returns false
		3 != 5	returns true
	</pre>
	<h1>
		Logical Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		This is also something that's more important when we're using conditional statements, but these are operators that work with boolean values 
	</p>
	<pre>
		!	Not, this flips the true/false outcome of a statement, for example, !(5 <= 6) would return false, 5 is less than 6, but the not flips the evaluation of true to be false
	</pre>
	<pre>
		&&	And, Say we have two expressions, (a <= b) && (b == 5), with the && operator both of these conditions would have to be true for the whole expression to evaluate to true, otherwise it results in false
	</pre>
	<pre>
		||	Or, Take (a <= b) and (b==5) again, but now it's (a<=b) || (b==5), now only one of those expressions needs to be true for the whole expression to evaluate to true, it's only false when both are false
	</pre>
	<h1>
		Type Casting
	</h1>
	<p>
		Type casting is a feature of C++ that allows you to convert a value from one data type to another, it looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		float z;
		int x = 5;
		z = (float) x;
		In this case, the int 5 is converted into the float 5
	</pre>
	<h1>
		String Arithmetic
	</h1>
	<p>
		You can combine strings together using the "+" operator. It looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		string x = "hello";
		x += "hi";
	</pre>
	<p>
		At this point, x would contain "hellohi"
	</p>

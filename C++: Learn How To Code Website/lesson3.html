		Now we're going to start really digging into the interesting stuff with your coding assignments.  In this chapter we're going to learn about operators in C++ and how we use them (namely to implement arithmetic)
	</p>

<div id="content"> 
	<h1>Assignment Operator</h1>
	<p>
		The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. For example
	</p>
	<pre>
		x=5;
	</pre>
	<p>
		This statement assigns the integer value 5 to the variable x. The assignment operation always takes place from right to left, and never the other way around.
	</p>
	<p>
		An important thing to keep in mind is that we are only assigning the value of y to x at the moment of the assignment operation. Therefore, if y changes at a later moment, it will not affect the new value taken by x. Let's go over a quick example to show how assignment operators work.
	</p>
	<pre>
		// assignment operator
		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		int main ()
		{
			int x, y;         // x:?,  y:?
			x = 9;            // x:9, y:?
			b = 4;            // x:9, y:5
			a = b;            // x:5, y:5
			b = 7;            // x:5, y:7
			
			cout << "x:";
			cout << x;
			cout << " y:";
			cout << y;
			// will print out "x:5, y:7"
		}
    </pre>
    <p>
		This program prints on screen the final values of x and y (5 and 7, respectively). Notice how x was not affected by the final modification of x, even though we previously declared x = y.
    </p>
	<h1>
		Arithmetic Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		Your arithmetic operators are:
	</p>
	<pre>
		| Operator      | Description   |
		| ------------- |:-------------:|
		| +             | Addition      |
		| -             | Subtraction   |
		| *             | Multiplication|
		| /             | Division      |
		| %             | Modulo        |
	</pre>
	<p>
		The modulo operator is similar to division except it gives you the remainder (e.g. 11 % 3 will return 2, since 11/3 gives a remainder of 2).
	</p>
	<h1>
		Compound Assignment Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		These operators are shortcuts of sort. They are used when you have an existing variable that you'd like to perform an operation on.  The ones for arithmetic are:  
	</p>
	<pre>
		| Operator      | Equivalent to |
		| ------------- |:-------------:|
		| y +=  x       | y = y + x     |
		| y -=  x       | y = y - x     |
		| x *=  y       | x = x * y     |
		| x /=  y       | x = x / y     |
	</pre>
	<p>
		Say you have a variable x which holds the value 5. If you would like to keep the variable assignment the same and add 5 to that value, you could write this like:
	</p>
	<pre>
		    // using simple operators
		    #include <iostream>
			using namespace std;
			int main ()
			{
				int x = 5;
				x = x + 5;    // equivalent to 5+5
				cout << x;    // prints 10
				}
	</pre>
	<p>
		Now suppose we wanted to take that same example and implement compound assignment operators. Our program would now look like this.
	</p>
	<pre>
		// using simple operators
		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		int main ()
		{
			int x = 5;
			x += 5;    // equivalent to 5+5
			cout << x;    // prints 10
		}
	</pre>
	<p>
		Both of these would be valid and would end with x being set equal to 10, the same concept applies to the rest of the compound assignment operators
	</p>
	<h1>
		Increment and Decrement Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		
These operators are typically used in loops (control structures that you'll be learning about soon!). They are useful when we want to add or subtract 1 from an already exisiting variable. They are written as the following.
	</p>
	<pre>
		    ++	Increment
		    --	Decrement   
	</pre>
	<p>
		So for example:
	</p>
	<pre>
		x++
		x += 1
		x = x + 1
	</pre>
	<p>
		Would all do the same thing!
	</p>
	<p>
		One important thing to note is using the increment/decrement operator as a suffix versus using it as a prefix  
		If the operator is used as a prefix, the value is incremented/decremented and then evaluated, if the operator is used as a suffix, the value is evaluated and then incremented/decremented
	</p>
	<p>
		For example:
	</p>
	<pre>
		x = 0
		y = ++x
		// x would hold 0, y would hold 1
		
		x = 0
		y = x++
		// x would hold 0, y would also hold 0
	</pre>
	<h1>
		Comparison Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		These are operators we use to determine if values are greater than, less than, or equal to other values.  The result of these operators is a "true or false" (or boolean) output.
	</p>
	<p>
		These operators are:
	</p>
	<pre>
		| Operator      | Description        |
		| ------------- |:------------------:|
		| ==            | Equal to           |
		| !=            | Not Equal to       |
		| <             | Less Than          |
		| >             | Greater Than       |
		| <=            | Less or Equal to   |
		| >=            | Greater or Equal to|
	</pre>
	<p>
		This is important later when we learn to use conditional statements, but some examples are:  
	</p>
	<pre>
		1 == 1	returns true
		2 <=1	returns false
		3 != 5	returns true
	</pre>
	<h1>
		Logical Operators
	</h1>
	<p>
		This is extremely important when using conditional statements. These are operators that work with boolean values (true or false)
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>! (Not)</b>: This flips the true/false outcome of a statement. For example, !(5 <= 6) would return false, 5 is less than 6, but the not flips the evaluation of true to be false
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>&& (And):</b>: Say we have two expressions, (a <= b) && (b == 5), with the && operator both of these conditions would have to be true for the whole expression to evaluate to true, otherwise it results in false
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>|| (Or):</b>, Take (a <= b) and (b==5) again, but now it's (a<=b) || (b==5), now only one of those expressions needs to be true for the whole expression to evaluate to true, it's only false when both are false
	</p>
	<h1>
		Type Casting
	</h1>
	<p>
		Type casting is a feature of C++ that allows you to convert a value from one data type to another, it looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		float z;
		int x = 5;
		z = (float) x;
	</pre>
	<p>
		In this case, the int 5 is converted into the float 5
	</p>
	<h1>
		String Arithmetic
	</h1>
	<p>
		You can combine strings together using the "+" operator. It looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		string x = "hello";
		x += "hi";
	</pre>
	<p>
		At this point, x would contain "hellohi"
	</p>

	<h1> Assignment # 3: Operators and Arithmetic </h1>

		For this assignment, you will be asked to implement a set of functions that follows a specific order. Follow the instructions in the comments above each function and run it when you're done to see if you passed.

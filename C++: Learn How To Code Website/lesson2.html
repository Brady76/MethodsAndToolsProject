		By now you've written your first C++ program, congratulations! Though the "Hello World" 
		program may seem a bit trivial, programming is not limited to printing simple sentences on screens. 
		In this chapter we're going to discuss variables as well as the data types *string*, *float*, *boolean*
		, and *int*. Variables will allow us to go a little further with the capabilities of C++ and they will 
		enable us to write programs that perform useful tasks.

<div id="content"> 
	<h1>Variables</h1>
	<p>
		A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a specific 
		type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within 
		that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable. </p>
	<p>
		So why use variables? Suppose we are asked to remember the number 2, and then we are asked to also memorize the number 
		7 at the same time. We now have 2 different values stored in our memory (2 and 7). Now, if we were asked to add 1 to the 
		first number stired, we should retain the numbers 3 (that is 2+1) and 7 in our memory. Then we could, for example, add 
		these values and obtain 10 as result.
	</p>
	
	<pre>
		a = 2;
		b = 7;
		a = a + 1;
		result = a + b;
	</pre>
	<p>
		Considering the fact that we've only used two small integer values, the previous example is pretty trivial. However, your 
		computer can store millions of numbers like these at the same time and conduct sophisticated mathematical operations with 
		them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each variable needs a unique name that identifies it and distinguishes it from the others. For example, in the previous 
		code the variable names were a, b, and result, but we could have called the variables any names we could have come up with, 
		as long as they were valid C++ identifiers.
	</p>
	







<div id ="assignment">
	<h1> Assignment # 1: Hello World </h1>
	<p>
		For our first practice assignment, we will implement our own version of our "Hello World" program. Open the <b>HelloWorld.cpp</b>
		file and edit/implement your code there. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to pass the test file, your code must include a function <b>int main()</b> that:
	</p>
	<p>
	1. Prints <b>Hello World</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		2. Prints <b>This is my first C++ program.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember that C++ is a case sensitive language and that spelling matters, so be sure to double check your work before running the test file.
	</p>

		Good Luck!

Lesson 1: Structure of a C++ Program
==========

Welcome to Lesson 1 of C++ tutorials! This lesson will introduce the basic structure of a C++ program. You will also implement your first program called "Hello World". Although it is a very simple, it contains the fundamental components of a C++ program.

Hello World
---------

The best way to learn a programming language is by writing programs. Here, we have a basic program that prints "Hellow World" (which is typically the first program that beginners write). We have broken down the program line by line to discuss what each component of our program does.

	//my first program in C++
	#include <iostream>
	
	int main()
	{
		std::cout << "Hello World!";
	}

Line 1: // My first program in C++




Executable Terminal Program
---------

Similar to any spoken language, C++ and all programming languages have a specific syntax or way on how things are written. To give you practice on C++ syntax, each lesson will include an interactive file that allows you to practice typing in the C++ language. 


Practice Assignemnts
--------

The key to becoming a great programmer is practice. In these tutorials, we have provided templates and test files for you to practice implementing your own code. Each section will have their own assignment in which you can practice writing your own code, and test files for each assignment so you'll know whether or not you have implemented your code correctly.

Remember, learning how to program takes a bit of patience, so be sure that you take your time when going through these lessons.

Have fun!

#include HelloWorld.cpp //We might want to make our actual assignment files into headers later, this speeds up compilation time. Just for future reference.  
//Also.. LOL, we can't test this file, it's cout statements, a pretty good test to see if it works or not would be for them to run it and see if it actually prints.

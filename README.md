# MethodsAndToolsProject: Learning the Basics of C++ 

Welcome to the C++ tutorials! The lessons in these tutorials are primarily designed to help beginning level programmers get a hands on grasp of the fundamentals of C++. Each turtorial is broken down into sections which contain examples, in depth explainations of code, and practice files for users to implement and test their own code! there is no suggested amount of time that you should spend with each section; progress through the material at a pace that is comfortable for you.

Before we get started, you will find that each chapter of this curriculum will be structured in a similar fashion.

## Lesson

In order to code, it is important to understand the basic concept on how C++ works. Each section will contain a README.md file that provides a detailed description on how the specific topic covered works, and a tutorial on how to implement that specific code.


## Executable Terminal Program

Similar to any spoken language, C++ and all programming languages have a specific syntax or way on how things are written. To give you practice on C++ syntax, each lesson will include an interactive file that allows you to practice typing in the C++ language. 


## Practice Assignemnts


The key to becoming a great programmer is practice. In these tutorials, we have provided templates and test files for you to practice implementing your own code. Each section will have their own assignment in which you can practice writing your own code, and test files for each assignment so you'll know whether or not you have implemented your code correctly.

Remember, learning how to program takes a bit of patience, so be sure that you take your time when going through these lessons.

Have fun!

### Lesson 1: Structure of a Program

**Goal:** Introduce what a basic c++ program looks like. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. *cout* command
2. Comments
3. Namespace 
4. #include
5. Main Function

**Exercise:** Hello World


### Lesson 2: Variables and Types

**Goal:** Introduce variable and types. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. Strings
2. Ints
3. Floats

**Exercise:** Quiz on different data types. This quiz quiz will be on our HTML website that will have a hide/show solution function.

### Lesson 3: Operators

**Goal:** Introduce basic operators. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. Variable assignment
2. basic arithmetic
--*addition 
--*subtraction 
--*multiplication 
--*division
3. string arithmetic

**Exercise:** Implement basic functions program that manipulates strings and numbers.

### Lesson 4: Control Structures (this section will be broken down into 2 parts)

#### Lesson 4.1: Intro to Statements
**Goal:** Introduce different types of statements. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. If Loops
2. For Loops
3. While Loops
4. Different statements
--* Jump Statements
--* Break Statements
--* Continue Statements

**Quiz:** What would be the output? (Quiz on different inputs regarding various statements. This quiz quiz will be on our HTML website that will have a hide/show solution function.)

**Exercise:** Implement a program using various types of loops

1. If: Tell whether an number is even or odd
2. For: write a summation function
--* int summation that takes parameter n
3. While: while your iterator is <= 16, print nah. if it is greater than 16, print batman
--* implement an iterator count up until 17 and returns batman

#### Lesson 4.2: Functions

**Goal:** Introduce functions (Structure program in segments of code to perform certain tasks)

**Exercise:** Brady can do this

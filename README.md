# Gamified C++ Curriculum 
This project will introduce beginners to the basics of C++

## Table of Contents

### Lesson 1: Structure of a Program

**Goal:** Introduce what a basic c++ program looks like. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. *cout* command
2. Comments
3. Namespace 
4. #include
5. Main Function

**Exercise:** Hello World


### Lesson 2: Variables and Types

**Goal:** Introduce variable and types. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. Strings
2. Ints
3. Floats

**Exercise:** Quiz on different data types. This quiz quiz will be on our HTML website that will have a hide/show solution function.

### Lesson 3: Operators

**Goal:** Introduce basic operators. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. Variable assignment
2. basic arithmetic
--*addition 
--*subtraction 
--*multiplication 
--*division
3. string arithmetic

**Exercise:** Implement basic functions program that manipulates strings and numbers.

### Lesson 4: Control Structures (this section will be broken down into 2 parts)

#### Lesson 4.1: Intro to Statements
**Goal:** Introduce different types of statements. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. If Loops
2. For Loops
3. While Loops
4. Different statements
--* Jump Statements
--* Break Statements
--* Continue Statements

**Quiz:** What would be the output? (Quiz on different inputs regarding various statements. This quiz quiz will be on our HTML website that will have a hide/show solution function.)

**Exercise:** Implement a program using various types of loops

1. If: Tell whether an number is even or odd
2. For: write a summation function
--* int summation that takes parameter n
3. While: while your iterator is <= 16, print nah. if it is greater than 16, print batman
--* implement an iterator count up until 17 and returns batman

#### Lesson 4.2: Functions

**Goal:** Introduce functions (Structure program in segments of code to perform certain tasks)

**Exercise:** Brady can do this

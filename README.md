# MethodsAndToolsProject: Learning the Basics of C++ 

Welcome to the C++ tutorials! The lessons in these tutorials are primarily designed to help beginning level programmers get a hands on grasp of the fundamentals of C++. Each turtorial is broken down into sections which contain examples, in depth explainations of code, and practice files for users to implement and test their own code! there is no suggested amount of time that you should spend with each section; progress through the material at a pace that is comfortable for you.

## Accessing These Lessons

We've provided 2 ways in which you can access these lessons. You can either **clone** this git hub repository, or download an HTML server that we have provided.

**If you choose to use git to download this repository:**

1. Open your terminal
2. Enter the command: "git clone https://github.com/Bradyta/MethodsAndToolsProject.git"
3. The repository should clone into whatever directory you have specified.

**If you choose to use HTML**

1. Open the HTML documentation file provided in this repo
2. Download the files given in the repo.
3. Once you have downloaded the specified files, you will be able to access all these lessons through your web browser!
⋅⋅1. You will be able to download the lesson excercises as you go along
⋅⋅2. You will have full access to the Who Wants to be a C++ Programmer quiz game

**If you choose to simply navigate through this repository:**

1. You can navigate through the lessons freely.
2. You will be able to download the lesson excercises as you go along!
3. You will have full access to the Who Wants to be a C++ Programmer quiz game!

The lessons are identical for each method, so choosing which medium you want to go through these tutorials with is all up to your personal preference!

Before we get started, you will find that each chapter of this curriculum will be structured in a similar fashion.

## Lesson

In order to code, it is important to understand the basic concept on how C++ works. Each section will contain a README.md file that provides a detailed description on how the specific topic covered works, and a tutorial on how to implement that specific code.

## Practice Assignments

The key to becoming a great programmer is practice. In these tutorials, we have provided templates and test files for you to practice implementing your own code. Each section will have their own assignment in which you can practice writing your own code, and test files for each assignment so you'll know whether or not you have implemented your code correctly.

Remember, learning how to program takes a bit of patience, so be sure that you take your time when going through these lessons.

Have fun!

### Lesson 1: Structure of a Program

**Goal:** Introduce what a basic c++ program looks like. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. *cout* command
2. Comments
3. Namespace 
4. #include
5. Main Function

**Exercise:** Hello World


### Lesson 2: Variables and Types

**Goal:** Introduce variable and types. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. Strings
2. Ints
3. Floats

**Exercise:** Quiz on different data types. This quiz quiz will be on our HTML website that will test you on the basics of variables and different data types.

### Lesson 3: Operators

**Goal:** Introduce basic operators. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. Variable assignment
2. basic arithmetic
--*addition 
--*subtraction 
--*multiplication 
--*division
3. string arithmetic

**Exercise:** Implement basic functions program that manipulates strings and numbers.

### Lesson 4: Control Structures (this section will be broken down into 2 parts)

#### Lesson 4.1: Intro to Statements
**Goal:** Introduce different types of statements. We will introduce the following concepts in this tutorial:

1. If/Else 
2. For Loops
3. While Loops
4. Different statements
--* Jump Statements
--* Break Statements
--* Continue Statements

**Exercise:** Implement a program using various types of loops

1. If: Tell whether an number is even or odd
2. For: write a summation function
--* int summation that takes parameter n
3. While: while your iterator is <= 16, print nah. if it is greater than 16, print batman
--* implement an iterator count up until 17 and returns batman

#### Lesson 4.2: Functions

**Goal:** Introduce functions (Structure program in segments of code to perform certain tasks)

1. Functions
2. Void Functions
3. Recursive Functions

**Exercise:** Implement a variety of functions

1. Practice using helper functions
2. Recursive summation for int x

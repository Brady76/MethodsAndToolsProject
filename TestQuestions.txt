1) What's the purpose of the line "using namespace std;"
	To invoke the standard namespace, which is  a container for a set of identifiers
2) What characters differentiate the name of a function and a variable?
	()
3) If we don't have the line "using namespace std;", how would we otherwise invoke a cout statement?
	std::cout <<

Variables and Types
----------
1) What data type would the value "5" be?
	String
2) int variable = 5
	Variable += 5
	What happens if this code is executed?
	Error, uninitialized variable 
3) Which of the following could the value 1 not belong to?
	A) Int
	B) Bool
	C) Float
	D) None of the Above
	D, 1 correlates to "true" in boolean
	
Operators and Arithmetic
----------
1) What's an alternate way to writing x++?
	x = x + 1;
2) Which operator can be used with strings?
	A) +
	B) -
	C) *
	D) %
	Answer is A
3) If we need two conditions to be true, which logical operator would we want to use?
	&&

Intro to Statements and Functions
----------
1) What are the three things that go in the set up of a for loop (between the parentheses) 
	initialization, condition, increment
	
2) We talked about two jump statements, what are they?
	Continue, Break

3) Which kind of loop requires you to initialize the iterator outside the loop?
